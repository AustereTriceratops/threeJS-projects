## The Hopf Fibration

The Hopf fibration is an unusual mapping of the (4-dimensional) hypersphere onto a sphere in which every point in the latter corresponds to a uniquely defined "fiber" in the former. This visualisation is based on [these notes by Niles Johnson](https://nilesjohnson.net/hopf-articles/Lyons_Elem-intro-Hopf-fibration.pdf).

## The Quaternion Julia set

A raymarching-based interactive visualization of the Quaternion Julia fractal. You can move around with wasd keys as well as using shift+space for vertical movement. You may also click to toggle whether the camera follows your mouse. There's a GUI on the top right that lets you freely choose the parameters of the fractal. If you're interested in the details, I'm writing a post on my [blog](https://austeretriceratops.wordpress.com/) and on [Medium](https://medium.com/@SereneBiologist) that will be out soon.
