## The Hopf Fibration

![](https://i.imgur.com/YIqx3yp.png)

The Hopf fibration is an unusual mapping of the (4-dimensional) hypersphere onto a sphere in which every point in the latter corresponds to a uniquely defined "fiber" in the former. This visualisation is based on [these notes by Niles Johnson](https://nilesjohnson.net/hopf-articles/Lyons_Elem-intro-Hopf-fibration.pdf).
